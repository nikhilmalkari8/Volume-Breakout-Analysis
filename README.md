# 📊 **Volume Breakout Analysis Tool**

This project is a **Volume Breakout Analysis Tool** that allows users to identify breakout opportunities in stocks based on volume and price criteria. The tool provides detailed reports, interactive visualizations, and performance metrics for various trading strategies.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

1. **User-Friendly Web Interface**  
   Enter your stock ticker, date range, and breakout criteria through an intuitive interface.

2. **Four Trading Strategies**  
   - **Breakout Strategy**: Buy when volume and price breakout criteria are met.
   - **SMA Crossover Strategy**: Buy when the 10-day SMA crosses above the 50-day SMA.
   - **Breakout Strategy with Risk Management**: Adds stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage risk.
   - **ML Predicted Breakouts**: Uses a Random Forest model to predict breakout days based on technical indicators.

3. **Detailed Reports**  
   - Downloadable CSV containing breakout dates, buy prices, sell prices, returns, and strategy names.
   - Performance metrics: **Win Rate**, **Average Return**, **Maximum Drawdown**.

4. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Plotly graphs for each strategy, showing **buy** and **sell points** clearly.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **Input Parameters**:  
   - **Ticker**: Stock symbol (e.g., `AAPL`).
   - **Start Date and End Date**: Date range for the analysis.
   - **Volume Breakout Threshold**: Minimum percentage increase in volume compared to the 20-day average (e.g., 200%).
   - **Daily Price Change Threshold**: Minimum percentage increase in price on breakout days (e.g., 2%).
   - **Holding Period**: Number of days to hold the stock after buying (e.g., 10 days).

2. **Generate Report**:  
   - The tool fetches historical stock data from `yfinance`.
   - It calculates breakout days based on user-defined criteria.
   - It evaluates trades based on four strategies and generates a CSV report.
   - Performance metrics are calculated and displayed.
   - Interactive plots for each strategy are generated and shown.

## 🧪 **Testing the ML Model**

The tool uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict breakout days based on:

- **Close Price**
- **Volume**
- **20-Day Average Volume**
- **10-Day SMA**
- **50-Day SMA**

You can test and improve the model by tuning hyperparameters or adding more features like **RSI** and **MACD**.
